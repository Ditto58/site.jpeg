Description (optional)
Well. First, I thought CodeSpaces were the answer. I was wrong. I played with it. Did something. Really though, I don't know. I was very dumb. The answer was a Google search... wow. I'm very bad at this. I have BIG plans for this test site. I would try and make games on here, but given my circumstances, that is a very, very, very, very bad idea. So, maybe on another account, another day. I'll probably play around with RenPy to go with the site. Anyways, I'll try and use the codespace correctly now. We'll see. Bye! -Ditto58, 10/15/2024

Well, I can't. I would VERY much apreciate some information on what the deployed site looks like, because it's blocked for me. So much for that. I wasn't even going to do anything bad with it! oh well. I'll see what I can do, maybe at home
